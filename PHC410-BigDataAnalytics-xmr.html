.pull-left[
- Outliers can cause problems with certain types of models. 

- If you have a legitimate reason to remove an outlier, it will help your model’s performance.

- However, outliers are *innocent until proven guilty*. You should never remove an outlier just because it’s a **big number**. That big number could be very informative for your model.

## Handle missing data

.pull-left[
- You cannot simply ignore missing values in your dataset! 

- Must handle in some way as most algorithms do not accept missing values.

- Most recommended ways to deal with missing data:
   -  Drop the observations
      -  When you drop observations, you drop information.
   -  Impute the missing values
      -  Missingness is almost always informative itself.

#Data Visualisation
## The Importance

- Review large amounts of data 
   – gain an understanding of what the data means very quickly – far more quickly than poring over spreadsheets or analyzing numerical tables.

- Spot trends 
   – time-sequence data often captures trends - make it easy to spot these trends, and in business terms a trend that is spotted early is an opportunity that can be acted upon.
   
- Identify correlations and unexpected relationships  
   - to discover what unexpected insights the data can reveal.
